			What qualifies as “a problem that affects Montrealers”
		</h3>
		<p class="a">
			The contest is open to most any type of problem that contestants might wish to address ; we encourage fun, diverse and innovative approaches that solve existing
			problems and help Montrealers in the process.
			<br/>
			A few ideas could include: avoiding traffic jams, discovering events/venues, finding parking/ cabs, working out with people, blind dates or flirting in a foreign
			language, helping the homeless, learning a language, car pooling, finding lost animals etc.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			<b>Solutions must present a Montreal-centric approach.</b>
		</p>
		<h3 class="q">

			Google+ Requirement
		</h3>
		<p  class="a">
			<b>Submitted entries must require the use of Google+ in some capacity.</b>

			solution, crowdsource your input through Google+ Pages by attracting followers and contributors etc.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			<b>A simple way to check whether this requirement is met is to ask : “would my solution be disabled if I removed the Google+ component”.<br> </b>The answer should be “yes”.</b>
